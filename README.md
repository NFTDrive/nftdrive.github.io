# NFT Drive to save docs in blockchain

NFT Drive is much more than an NFT.

NFT Drive is the evolution of paper, floppy disk, flash memory and the cloud, with our DApp the files are stored in the interplanetary file system IPFS and registered in the blockchain in perpetuity

Share secret information, register works and prove their existence in time

The information uploaded to the blockchain is immutable and will never change.

How it works
Save an NFT Drive in your Metamask wallet which you can get above, find your purchase transaction and identify your NFT Drive contract number

Go to "UP file" in the menu of this DApp and connect your wallet

Write a name or description for your file, upload it to the interplanetary file system or IPFS and save it on the blockchain

You can read files or delete records in the NFT Drive, but files uploaded to the IPFS are not deleted, they will remain in the interplanetary file system.

You can lend, rent, sell or give away your NFT to anyone
